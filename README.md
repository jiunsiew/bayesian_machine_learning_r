# Introduction
Self tutorial on how to do EM algorithm and also some Gaussian processes.  

Includes a few things:

- bayesian_machine_learning_r:
R port of notebooks from https://github.com/krasserm/bayesian-machine-learning 
for learning

- Some additional code that experiments with stan and tensorflow probability 
gaussian process examples.  

- Tries to use the co2 data example from Rasmussen et. al
